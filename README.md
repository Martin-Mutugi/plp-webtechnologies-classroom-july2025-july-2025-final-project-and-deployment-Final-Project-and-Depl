## 🎯 Project Purpose

The Lumen Archive is a sophisticated, multi-page website serving as the digital home for a fictional "Institute of Light & Time." Its core mission is to showcase a curated collection of photography that explores the profound and beautiful interplay of illumination and moment. The project demonstrates advanced front-end development skills, including semantic HTML5, modern CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, responsive design, and seamless deployment.

Built as a final project for the PLP Web Technologies course, it is designed to stand out in competition through its unique thematic concept, flawless user experience, and clean, maintainable codebase.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
